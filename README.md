# hash_function_python

designed to be a good-enough hash, not relying on libraries
    that includes string and timestamp

    the timestamp kind of functions as a 'secret key'
    as in crypographic 'signing' and verification
    again: not meant to be super world class,
    but light weight and easy to debug,
    not likely to have unexpected or incomprehensible issues
    no external libraries, trust issues, etc. 
    
    the first few digits are less random, so -> removed
    this also keeps the hash from getting huge so quickly

    to make the numbers more significantly different if even one
    input character is changed: add an additional hash if the 
    current hash is odd/even (even picked here)
